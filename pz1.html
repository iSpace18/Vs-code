  <h1>Vehicle</h1>

  <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><b><a href="jjj5">[1]</a></b></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.m<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
  
  <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.m<sup><b>[3]</b></sup></p>
