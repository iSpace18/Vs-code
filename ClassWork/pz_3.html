 <h1> Mathematical formulas</h1>

<h2>Linear Equations</h2>

<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
<div>
<P class="Formula_1">ax + b = 0</P>
</div>

<p>where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are real numbers and <b>x</b> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <b>x</b> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <b>x</b> there.</p>

<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

<div>
  <p class="Formula_2">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
</div>

<p>where <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are known values and <b>x</b> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <b>a</b> can't be 0.</p>

<h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

<p> <b>&pi;</b> (Pi) times the radius (<b>r</b>) squared:</p>
<div>
  <p class="Formula_3">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup>
  </div>

<p>or, when you know the diameter (<b>D</b>)</p>

<div>
  <p class="Formula_4">A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup>
  </div>

<p>or, when you know the circumference (<b>C</b>):</p>
<div>
  <p class="Formula_5">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;
  </div>


<h2>Intersection</h2>

<p>The intersection of two sets <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

<div>
  <p class="Formula_6">A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }
  </div>

<p>That is, <b>x</b> is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if <b>x</b> is both an element of <b>A</b> and an element of <b>B</b>.</p>
